This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This is going to be my sandbox for learning React!

I will be updating this project frequently with a lot of beginner React code.


## Why React?
* I like the idea of using React because it is a library and not a framework.
* Want to work with a virtual browser
* React is just Javascript
* React is battle tested!
* React is declarative for dynamic data

## React Basic Concepts
#### Components
* like functions
* Input: props, state | Output: UI
* Reusable and composable
* Can manage a private state
#### Reactive Updates
* React will react
* Take updates to the browser
#### Virtual views in memory
* Generate HTML using JS
* No HTML template language

#### React Components
* Function Components
* Class Components

## JSX is NOT HTML!!!
